## CS428/528 Project-3: UDP Pinger

### SUMMARY

For Part 1, our program creates a server socket, which allows connection to a single client and handles the HTTP request. The server then sends a message to the client depending on whether or not the requested file is present.

For Part 2, our program handles the same task as Part 1, but is capable of serving multiple request simultanesously across multiple browsers.
